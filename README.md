This project is built on the code presented by Hamed Bahram in the YouTube vidoeo [Server actions, RSC, Prisma, and TypeScript in NextJs 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e35eo447Zw) where I have replaced the Primsa/MongoDb part with graphql queries and mutations to a Headless Wordpress WPGRAPHQL endpoint.

The Typescript types are generated by the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) - see also a [YouTube video by Kellen Mace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74JkP9CUWiI&t=899s) at WPEngine Builders.
